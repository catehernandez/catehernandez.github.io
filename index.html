    Hi! My name is Cate. I'm a full-stack developer with plenty of school
    experience working in Java and C. In the past few years, I've also picked up
    Python, React, and a little bit of Node.js. I'm pretty good with HTML and
    CSS too.

    This site was built with Jekyll & deployed on GitHub pages. I built the UI
    from scratch. You can see the source code <a href="">here</a>.
