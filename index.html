    Hi! My name is Cate. I'm a full-stack developer with school experience
    working in Java and C. In the past few years, I've also picked up Python,
    React, and a little bit of Node.js. I'm pretty good with HTML and CSS too.

    This site was built with Jekyll & deployed on GitHub pages. I built the UI
    from scratch. You can see this site's
    <a href="https://github.com/zenon21/zenon21.github.io" target="_blank">
      source code
    </a>
    on GitHub, and you can read more about how I built it (and what I'm working
    on next) on
    <a
      href="https://zenon21.blogspot.com/search/label/my%20site"
      target="_blank"
      >my blog</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    I care about accessibility. I'm still learning, so if you have any feedback
    for me, please
    <a href="https://github.com/zenon21/zenon21.github.io/issues">
      raise an issue
    </a>
    on this site's GitHub repository.
