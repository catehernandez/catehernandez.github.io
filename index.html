    Hi! My name is Cate. I'm a full-stack developer with school experience
    working in Java and C. In the past few years, I've also picked up Python,
    React, and a little bit of Node.js. I'm pretty good with HTML and CSS too.

    This site was built with Jekyll & deployed on GitHub pages. I built the UI
    from scratch. You can see the source code on
    <a href="https://github.com/zenon21/zenon21.github.io" target="_blank"
      >my GitHub page</a
    >, and you can read more about how I built it (and what I'm working on next)
    on
